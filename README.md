#trim: A Cross-platform Video & Input Console/Terminal Interface Library

TRIM is designed as an equivalent to a stripped-down SDL for any console/terminal.
TRIM is still work-in-progress, but it is capable of drawing a "framebuffer" of coloured ASCII to the console window
 and retrieving input directed at the console for Windows, Mac and most other Unix-based systems, including Linux.
